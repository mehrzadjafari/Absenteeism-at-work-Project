**Goal of the homework**: To build a machine learning model capable of predicting hours of absenteeism at workd based on different related attributes.

## Main Steps:
    > 1. Preprocessing, Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
    > 2. Modeling
    > 3. Model Comparison
    > 4. Hyperparameter tuning by RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV
    > 5. Evaluting the final model
    > 6. Feature Importance


## The repository consists of the following files:

1. __`HW5.ipynb`__: 
	> A Jupyter notebook which consists of outputs, comments, visualizations and further explanations.
2. __`data`__:
    > The folder containing the dataset that I have used for this project. ([Source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work))
